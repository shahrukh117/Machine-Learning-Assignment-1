    "1) **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:\n",
    "   Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. AI systems can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. One example of AI is virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa. These assistants can understand natural language commands, perform tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, or playing music, and even learn user preferences over time to provide more personalized responses.\n",

    "2) **Machine Learning (ML)**:\n",
    "   Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. One common example of machine learning is spam email detection. ML algorithms can be trained on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam. By analyzing features such as the frequency of certain words or patterns in the email content, the algorithm learns to classify new emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Deep Learning**:\n",
    "   Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to extract high-level features from raw data. Deep learning models can automatically learn to represent data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing them to perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition with remarkable accuracy. An example of deep learning is image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs can learn to recognize objects in images by analyzing patterns of pixels at different scales and orientations, mimicking how the human visual system processes information. Applications of CNNs include self-driving cars, medical image analysis, and facial recognition systems."
